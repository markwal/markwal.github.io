I used to write software for a living. Then I was a manager for a living.
Now, or at least for a while, I mess around (by mess around, I mean make
messes) with software, electronics and 3d printing as hobbies instead.

This isn't really a blog. The time order is just time of original post kinda
like a blog, but since it's really a reference for me later, I just update stuff
to be more useful without trying too hard to keep history. There's a git log for
that.
