I used to write software for a living. Then I was a manager for a living.
Now, or at least for a while, I mess around (by mess around, I mean make
messes) with software, electronics and 3d printing as hobbies instead.

I know there's rules about blogs how they are supposed to be point in time
and updates are supposed to be new posts so that people can consume them and
the trailing edge. I don't care. Some of my posts I write for my own reference
and I'm gonna update them to be more useful for that purpose. I know I could
create pages for that purpose, but hey, I'm lazy.
